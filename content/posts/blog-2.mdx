## About .map

Welcome to this guide on the .map method. The `.map` function has to be one
of my favorite functions just because of how often it is useful.
I have to admit, initially I did not understand why you would use a map, I stuck
to my for loops and `forEaches`

## An Example

```jsx
// test
() => {
  const list = [1, 2, 3]

  return (
    <center>
      {list.map(li => (
        <li key={li}>{li}</li>
      ))}
    </center>
  )
}
```
