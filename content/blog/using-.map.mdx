## About .map

Welcome to this guide on the .map method. The `.map` function has to be one
of my favorite functions just because of how often it is useful.
I have to admit, initially I did not understand why you would use a map, I stuck
to my for loops and `forEaches` because they were what I was familiar with,
not necessarily thinking about what is the best **solution**.

## An Example

Let's say we have this array below.

```js
const arrayOfNumbers = [2, 8, 42];
```

And we wish to double every number in that array, and return it to another array.

In the past, I would have done this:

```js
const arrayOfNumbers = [2, 8, 42];
const results = [];

arrayOfNumbers.forEach(number => {
  results.push(number * 2);
});

// results now equals [4, 16, 84]
```

As we can see, it works. It's a solution to the problem. But how can this be improved upon?

## Introducing .map

```js {2}
const arrayOfNumbers = [2, 8, 42];
const results = arrayOfNumbers.map(number => number * 2);

// results now equals [4, 16, 84]
```

Wow, that saved us about two lines of code.
