The `.map` function is something I use pretty much every day when developing.
It's one of those functions that once when you understand what it does, you will
find out it comes in handy in most situations.

## What is .map?

According to the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), an explanation for this function would be:

> The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

## An Example

Let's say we have this array below.

```js
const arrayOfNumbers = [2, 8, 42];
```

And we wish to double every number in that array, and return it to another array.

In the past, I would have done this:

```js
const arrayOfNumbers = [2, 8, 42];
const results = [];

arrayOfNumbers.forEach(number => results.push(number * 2));

// results now equals [4, 16, 84]
```

As we can see, it works. It's a solution to the problem. But how can this be improved upon?

## Introducing .map

```js {2}
const arrayOfNumbers = [2, 8, 42];
const results = arrayOfNumbers.map(number => number * 2);

// results now equals [4, 16, 84]
```

Okay, so what did that do except for saving us two lines of code? As you can see, we don't need to create an empty array and then push to that. `.map` returns every result into an empty array by default.
