## About .map

Welcome to this guide on the .map method. The `.map` function has to be one
of my favorite functions just because of how often it is useful.
I have to admit, initially I did not understand why you would use a map, I stuck
to my for loops and `forEaches` because they were what I was familiar with,
not necessarily thinking about what is the best **solution**.

## An Example

```js react-live
() => {
  const a = 1;
  return a;
};
```
